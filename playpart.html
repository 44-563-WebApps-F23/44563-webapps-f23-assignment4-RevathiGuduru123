    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech"><span class="direction">[In a low voice.]</span> What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
        positively dripping.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"> It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.</p>
    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech"> It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"> Lord, how you talk, Regina.<span class="direction">[Limps a step or two forward into
            the room.]</span> It's just this as I wanted to say--.</p>
    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech">Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
        master's asleep upstairs.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"> Asleep? In the middle of the day?</p>

    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech">It's no business of yours.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"> I was out on the loose last night--</p>

    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech">I can quite believe that.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"> Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--</p>

    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech">So it seems.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech">--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. But all
        the same, I was hard at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.</p>

    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech">Very well; only be off now. I won't stop here and have
        _rendezvous's_<span class="direction">[Note: This and other French words by Regina are in that
            language in the original]</span>with you.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech">What do you say you won't have?</p>

    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech">I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your
        business.</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"><span class="diection">[Advances a step or two.]</span> Blest if I go before I've had
        a talk with you. This afternoon I shall have finished my work at the
        school house, and then I shall take to-night's boat and be off home to
        the town.</p>
    
    <h6 class="Regina"> REGINA </h6>
    <p class="speech"><span class="direction">[Mutters.]</span> Pleasant journey to you!</p>

    <h6 class="Engstrand"> ENGSTRAND </h6>
    <p class="speech"> Thank you, my child. To-morrow the Orphanage is to be opened,and then there'll be fine doings, no doubt, and plenty of intoxicating drink going, you know. And nobody shall say of Jacob Engstrand that he can't keep out of temptation's way.</p>
