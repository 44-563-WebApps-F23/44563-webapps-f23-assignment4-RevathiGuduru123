        ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.<br>

        REGINA. It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
        the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--<br>
        
        REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
        master's asleep upstairs.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Asleep? In the middle of the day?<br>
        
        REGINA. It's no business of yours.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. I was out on the loose last night--<br>
        
        REGINA. I can quite believe that.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--<br>
        
        REGINA. So it seems.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND.--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. But all
        the same, I was hard at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.<br>
        
        REGINA. Very well; only be off now. I won't stop here and have
        _rendezvous's_ [Note: This and other French words by Regina are in that
        language in the original] with you.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. What do you say you won't have?<br>
        
        REGINA. I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your
        business.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. [Advances a step or two.] Blest if I go before I've had
        a talk with you. This afternoon I shall have finished my work at the
        school house, and then I shall take to-night's boat and be off home to
        the town.<br>
        
        REGINA. [Mutters.] Pleasant journey to you!<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Thank you, my child. To-morrow the Orphanage is to be opened,
        and then there'll be fine doings, no doubt, and plenty of intoxicating
        drink going, you know. And nobody shall say of Jacob Engstrand that he
        can't keep out of temptation's way.<br>
        
        REGINA. Oh!<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. You see, there's to be heaps of grand folks here to-morrow.
        Pastor Manders is expected from town, too.<br>
        
        REGINA. He's coming to-day.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. There, you see! And I should be cursedly sorry if he found
        out anything against me, don't you understand?<br>
        
        REGINA. Oho! is that your game?<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Is what my game?<br>
        
        REGINA. [Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders
        into doing, this time?<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
        no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
        just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.<br>
        
        REGINA. The sooner the better, say I.<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. Yes, but I want you with me, Regina.<br>
        
        REGINA. [Open-mouthed.] You want me--? What are you talking about?<br>
        
        ENGSTRAND. I want you to come home with me, I say.<br>
        
        REGINA. [Scornfully.] Never in this world shall you get me home with<br>
        you.
        
        ENGSTRAND. Oh, we'll see about that.<br>
